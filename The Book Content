HODL 2032 - Diary from a citadel
Preface and Acknowledgement
This book portrays a fictional future in which the dominance of the US dollar, the euro and the Chinese yuan is a thing of the past. But not everything is fictitious; many of the developments and technologies discussed in the book are already in evidence, more or less inevitable, or have already occurred. Topics such as the militarization of the police, increasing surveillance of the population in democracies as well as in dictatorships, online as well as in real life, global warming, a progressive fragmentation of the population into increasingly radicalizing political camps, humanitarian catastrophes and the refugee crises developing from them, and the struggle for natural resources such as water or raw materials, as well as the race in space and the sword of Damocles hanging over everything, global pandemics are already visible in the year 2020 even without crystal balls. I would like to add another critical aspect to all these developments in this book: a turning away of populations from the euro, the dollar and the yuan to another, modern, harder and more inclusive currency - Bitcoin. In the future I have outlined, the absurd militarization of the police force in the United States has led to an exodus of so-called "earlies" - people who have invested in Bitcoin in 2017 and before. These people felt increasingly harassed and restricted in their freedom by state organs and institutions. When the advisors of Mc Kinsey and XXX calculated the government how many billions in tax revenues would be generated by this weather hexite. 
The increasing repressions and the meanwhile ludicrously high taxation of profits from capital gains generated by the price increase of Bitcoin are draconianly taxed, especially in the countries of the IS. This was necessary to supply the military apparatus with resources. The situation was further aggravated by a law reinitiated by Donald Trump in 2017, which allows U.S. police authorities to take over war equipment such as armored vehicles and bayonets from former army stocks. This led to a significant militarization of the police force on U.S. soil. This highly armed police force was used as early as 2020 to suppress protests against the government, sometimes brutally. Since many early adopters had long doubted the credibility of the U.S. government's benevolence, this development led to a quiet and clandestine exodus of "Earlies" and thus considerable capital to other, more Bitcoin-friendly jurisdictions to live a quiet and undisturbed life in freedom. 
This book is supposed to be about such a person.

Joke
Saturday, February 3, 2032 - 9:00 a.m. in a suburb of Atlanta
My cell phone vibrates: "Congratulations, let's take a spin in your Bentley?" HODLORD, gets on my nerves again. "What Bentley?" I sometimes borrow my girlfriend's car and otherwise I'm on the road with my old, crappy bike. As a poor student I can't afford a car, let alone a luxury car like this, so I'm somewhat surprised by the comment. I sit down at the keyboard and write back: "I'll do it as soon as I can afford it XD". Two minutes later my cell phone vibrates: "Don't be so stingy, you can do it now! "What kind of garbage are you talking?" I ask back, carefully imitating the slang of my counterpart. "Boy, did you check your BTC address?" A circle symbol indicates that HODLORD is currently sending me a file. Reluctantly I click on the symbol - I don't want to contaminate my cell phone with a virus but I am too curious to run the virus scan. The picture shows my pseudonym: BTChap, the picture of my avatar and a Bitcoin address, and below it the current balance: 6.15 BTC. "LOL - nice Try" I write back. Classic Troll Move. Probably he faked the image or - less likely - was my account hacked? I get curious. I scroll down to the page with my account details:


Name: BTChap. BTC address: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
The address looks similar to the one HODLORD sent me, but that doesn't mean anything, as I said, the picture sent to me can be faked. I copy the address and enter it in the block explorer: - Current balance: 6.15 BTC. The block explorer does not lie, it accesses the data of the Bitcoin block chain stored worldwide. Actually: Balance: 6.15 BTC. "Fuck, fuck, FUCK!" I swear to myself. "Which one of you idiots did this to me I think to myself. With sweaty hands I fumble the SD card out of the card slot of my laptop. Just now my life was boring routine - one click later I'm in serious trouble. Someone apparently transferred 6.15 Bitcoins to an address that I posted on the SocialNet for what felt like eternities ago. Now I'm a wanted man not only with the US authorities but also with various much shadier characters. These 6.15 Bitcoins have a value of almost exactly 12 million US dollars at the current exchange rate. A minute ago I was a short-sighted lean IT student - now I have been catapulted into the famous "top 1%" of the US population. I am still nearsighted.

My problem: My new wealth awakens desires, in other words, I am delivered. For a 24-year-old ambitious good-for-nothing like me, such sudden wealth has drastic consequences. Are they already on my heels? I look hurriedly out of the kitchen window - 5th floor in the dormitory - that gives me a good overview. I close the blinds - not without first taking a furtive look out of the window - so far I can neither see nor hear any surveillance drones, but that doesn't have to mean anything, surveillance technology has made great progress in recent years. Worse: Everyone who follows me on the SocialNet now knows that I have been a multimillionaire for a few minutes. Swatting and doxxing are even more harmless things that a creative troll could come up with. I grab my backpack and stuff my VR glasses and my wallet as well as my compressible multifunctional jacket my old but faithful laptop my cell phone my wallet into it. I put on sunglasses and a breathing mask. Then I look around my apartment and stormed to the door. I still have no idea that I would never enter the apartment again. I rush down the five floors, the elevator has been out of order for months. Probably the police are already on their way here. Since the US dollar is losing more and more value, they are not going to torch it much longer when it comes to confiscating capital or what they call "tax collection". I rush into the bicycle cellar, rip my old racing bike out of the stand and carry it out onto the street. Protected by my mask and sunglasses I start riding. Where to? Anywhere. More important than the direction is the distance covered. The Corona Crisis of 2020 may have brought many economies and thus currencies to the brink of collapse, but it also had its good points for paranoids like me. Today, even in western countries, you can wear a face mask without immediately standing out from the crowd. Of course it is a bit uncomfortable when cycling, but at least it helps to mislead the surveillance cameras installed on every street corner and the omnipresent swarms of drones and autonomous vehicles with their stereo cameras.  If they catch me now I won't be going anywhere for a while. While I'm pedaling through Atlanta without a goal but as straight as a die and at breakneck speed, my cell phone runs amok. HODLORD apparently shared the photo he sent me with his followers. My new wealth is currently drawing more and more circles in the SocialNet. Not good. Again I made a mistake - I brake so hard that a quietly whirring electric car behind me with squealing tires takes an evasive maneuver. Autonomously driving cars fortunately react within milliseconds. If a human driver had been behind the wheel, I would probably be seriously injured. Anyway, with trembling hands I pull my cell phone out of my pocket and open the account 138 new messages the picture of HODLORD with my account information and the BTC balance - already shared 40 times - it is always interesting how fast such messages go viral. I set my account to private so that nobody but me can see and share my content. 

4h Later in Stockholm 
Astrid is rudely awakened from her sleep by the penetrating ringing of her cell phone: She looks at the display: "Damn Kato here it's 3:30 in the morning. It better be something important," a baritone voice on the other end of the line laughs briefly at "Relax, I thought the CAU had always been at the service of justice? His words dripped with sarcasm. Astrid sits up in bed and takes a deep breath in and out. "What do you want?". "I may have a lucrative package for you." "What is it about exactly?". "My social network crawler discovered something interesting yesterday. Poked a picture shared by a "HODLORD." Allegedly a guy who is registered on the SocialNet under the pseudonym BTChap yesterday got 6.15 Bitcoins transferred to an address he posted in 2015. If the seizure is successful, you could retire forever with the success fee". Astrid turns over the numbers briefly in her head. Kato is right. Alternatively, she could give her mother the necessary stem cell therapy. Never again dialysis - a very tempting prospect. "Are you sure it's not a fake from some troll?" Her attention is caught, also because the little fish she has caught in the net in the last six months are just enough to pay for her mother's treatment and the rent here in Stockholm. "To some extent, I've looked at his posts. The address has not changed since 2015 and the transfer has now been confirmed 75 times. So he is actually in possession of the UTXOs". "If he still has the keys to the wallet - do we know where he is and what his name is?" "Yes, the last log in was an IP address from a dormitory at Georgia State University - I can only guess his real name, he only logged in under his pseudonym. This is evidence of a healthy paranoia. Apparently he ordered a shirt from AllGood in september 2017 and used the same email address for his order as he used for SocialNet. I was able to link the identities. His name is Christopher Goldsworthy" Astrid frowns. "Have the authorities or the local police done anything yet? "So far, nothing that I know of." What else is there on him? "The guy's a poor sucker if you believe his bank account." IT security study gag. Could explain his paranoia about not logging on to the social network with his real name. It's rare." She smiles, that probably saved him from prison or worse. "What about his current cell phone data - cell phone access points? GPS coordinates? IP addresses of wlan access points?" - "Nothing. His cell phone's been dead for four hours." "Do the Yanks know we're on it?" - "You know me, Astrid. I'm discreet and professional as always." She rolls her eyes. The fat buff is probably lying in a VR tank in Addis again and is having a good time. "Thank you Kato - please keep me informed, mobile network monitoring, face recognition - the full program. But make sure that the Americans don't notice anything of our interest in the topic". "All right, official or unofficial e-mail address?" what a stupid question. "As always" "Will do, sweetheart" with a disgusted facial expression hangs up Astrid.
"Sure - sent a drone immediately. Apartment is orphaned, he has apparently flown out". Goldsworthy - sounds like douchebag. "He hasn't shown up again yet?" "No, he hasn't registered with the usual CarPooling Services, nor has he identified himself with his multipass in the suspension railroad or the Uber. He must be on foot." "What do we know about this guy?" "IT student. Studying IT security in Atlanta. Scalawag. Keeps his head above water with petty Internet scams.


She can't stand Kato, that pompous arrogant overweight busybody who hardly ever moves out of his VR tank. These things are practical - you don't get bedsores because you are in a salt water bath that is adjusted to make you virtually weightless. The hoses for food supply and the rest are not everyone's cup of tea, but once you've handled them you'll never have to leave VR again. Pathetic existence but Kato at least knows what he is doing and what he is doing with his share of the profits is not important to Astrid anyway.
What is much more important - this Goldsworthy can't be far away, if he hasn't used public transport so far, for which he would have had to reveal his identity without a doubt. It is also interesting that there has not yet been any positive confirmation from the omnipresent surveillance cameras. Although the data generated by the surveillance cameras is stored on US servers, it is an open secret that almost every secret service and various hackers have access to this database. It is easy for authorities to locate any person on US soil who is not wearing a disguise in a very short time. The rest has to take some money and look around in Dark Net. This is not rocket science either. What is particularly perfidious is that the authorities also have access to the camera data of the delivery drones of the two dominant online retailers FoodNet and GoodNet. The companies never openly admitted this, but a series of leaks from whistleblowers and a brief research in Dark Net proves the opposite. 
Astrid is an undercover investigator for CAU - the Currency Acquisition Unit of the Independent States (IS). A special unit that supplies the Independent States with hard currency. The main focus of her work is the collection of exit tax - a tax that people from the community she works for have to pay. This is similar to the procedure of the Russian, Chinese and North Korean secret services in the 20th century. The CAU's goal is not to fight terrorist subversive or separatist efforts, but rather to raise hard currency to pay for the other parts of the UL security apparatus. The military and police officers of the UL have not been able to be paid in the respective national currencies for quite some time now, as their purchasing power has fallen dramatically. A new source of hard currency is therefore needed to ensure the loyalty of these important government officials.
She lives in a penthouse loft in Stockholm this apartment has a panic room where her bed is located this panic room is small enough for a small bedside table with a laptop and her bed the walls are made of solid steel and the door is heavily armored she sold her supervisor the procurement of such a panic room as necessary for her work in reality this panic room seems to be the right place for her Retinal implant failure of the cage means inside she is sure that only what she sees remains personal to her so to speak I have a crew of several single areas with privacy because once the panic room theory is closed it is no longer possible for her superiors to log into her wiped feed normally she communicates with how large the lake loads an instruction on an encrypted USB stick and this USB Stick Dahl with a note from her housekeeper has this complex procedure sent to the post office by mail. This is necessary because of course all incoming and outgoing data connections can be monitored by her liaison officer via  fiber optic cable. 

The agent has a retinal implant, which not only enables her to display augmented reality functionalities in the peripheral retinal area, but also enables her liaison officer to access her "LiveFeed" at any time - for example to check whether she has embezzled confiscated currency. However, the agent has no way of knowing whether this has actually ever happened. The CAU is thus concerned with "debt capital consolidation" - another word for government-sponsored theft. In fact, such a procedure is known - a prominent example is the privateer Francis Drake who, in the name of the English Crown, robbed merchants and sailors of their wealth as early as the 15th century. It can only move outside the legality of the IS to a certain extent, as it is monitored via the net heap. The really bad things are done by Wikus. Whether the retinal implant is actually permanent or just randomly monitored or even monitored at all, Astrid knows that even if she would break the law she would never be punished this would never be punished as the government is too dependent on the foreign exchange he procures from it to allow itself to initiate an investigation against one of its most successful agents

Woke
I stop at a gas station, I am parched, the summer in Atlanta is not very suitable for long bicycle tours. The sultry heat is bothering me.

Hunt
Currency Acquisition Unit collects exit tax, which was enacted by Clinton in xxx during the Clinton administration and extended to digital currencies by President Trump in his second term in XXXX. The CAU's powers are so extensive that it can take over both the judicial and executive branches and can also and especially operate outside the U.S. and even the IS. This 2022 amendment to the law resulted in a dramatic exodus of high net individuals, who increasingly concentrated on citadels scattered around the world.

Refuge
I slam the door of the rickety pickup and fumble for my now completely destroyed cell phone: 
A new message from "Meeting place placa majyor in front of the church". "Where should that be?". The cheap cell phone I bought from a farmer including SIM card for a horrendous amount of money shows a message from Peter. I'm here - come I get into a rocking boat and we go out on the Pacific. "Peter, are you sure this sloop is safe?" Peter looks at me questioningly. "Why?" I choose to ignore his remark. A high cloud of spray appears on the horizon, a few seconds later I begin to hear a low hum that swells to a deafening one. Surrounded by salty fog an amphibian boat appears. 

The street is filled with smoke and noise, in front of me is a wall of police officers and police robots equipped with laser beams and old-fashioned looking shotguns. These are loaded with rubber bullets and pepper spray cartridges. "not again" I think with grinding teeth. The rifles and truncheons should help to keep the agitated group of people on the other side of the protective wall of plexiglass shields in check. There an angry, masked mob waves, roars, beats, throws paving stones and occasionally burning bottles. This aggressive crowd crashes and roars against the Plexiglas signs and police barriers with which the state apparatus tries to protect itself. I can see through the blurred glass of my gas mask, which is supposed to protect me from the irritant gas the police is spraying as well as from the biting smoke of burning gasoline and plastic. Above us the monotonous hum of drones hovering like giant mosquitoes over the crowd. Everything is streamed scanned by the systems and stored and catalogued in cool bunkers so that the data stream can later be assembled into a complete three-dimensional hologram for forensic purposes. Admittedly, neither the police forces nor the mob are currently wasting a single thought on the consequences of their actions - everyone is fully occupied with the here and now. I look around in the chaos, the crowd chanting "we are the people" and "I cant't breathe". On my left I become aware of a masked man infecting a Molotov cocktail and throwing it in my direction. The droning of the police sirens suddenly stretches to a deep tone, as if in slow motion I see the incendiary device spinning in my direction, I am unable to move, caught between the sweating and flailing bodies. Then the image flickers and I take off the VR glasses. It is warm and a gentle sea breeze blows around me. I wear linen pants, sandals to be able to bear the tropical warmth of the year XXX. With a glass of ice-cold gin I stand on the balcony of my tree-house lodge on the beach of Costa Rica and watch the Pacific sunset, behind me the impenetrable vegetation of the jungle, from which the sound of the jungle's sonic carpet reaches my ear. I look at my watch in which a complex interplay of springs and gears tells me the time: a relic from a long gone time that is neither practical nor affordable for most people. It is the evening of 22 July 2137 and tomorrow the last credits will be mined. For me the watch has another special feature. In 2045, as part of my normal service, I had a multi-pass NFC chip installed between the movement and the case in the Oyster case of my Submariner Reference 114060 by an old Argentinean watchmaker who is still involved in the art of restoring such antiques. This chip contains all the data that is important to me, such as my Costa Rica 1 access certificates, my academic degrees, my family tree, blood group, my health record, which is monitored by a private company. By means of the scales in my lodge and a urinalysis, which is automatically carried out when I use the toilet, all vital values are monitored and I am informed by Jarvis if values are out of the norm. Since Jarvis is a "Stand Alone" AI, it acts as a firewall for my private data and can independently derive findings from the measured values and discuss them with a professional if necessary. This ensures that my biodata never leaves the Citadelle without my consent. So Jarvis can rightfully be called my personal personal physician. Such services are paid for via the Multipass NFC chip, which most residents have had implanted in the back of their hands or wrists. In most cases, a second factor - such as an iris scan or a fingerprint and voice confirmation - is also required, although these precautions may not be necessary in an acute emergency, depending on how the user's MultiPass is configured. 

For severe cases, the Compound has an MRI and a CT, which are available free of charge to every user with transfer of the annual accommodation fee. The raw data generated by the system is then, after the user has been tuned in, made available to an AI emergency doctor, for example. These services access a worldwide medical database and produce diagnoses and treatment plans with an amazingly high success rate. Emergency operations can also be performed in an automated operating room by AI using micromanipulators. However, this requires trust in the operator of the AI emergency room, which is why I prefer to leave this activity to Jarvis. 

The compound is located behind walls several meters high and is guarded by professional staff from a private security company, but they are very discreet and appear now and then during checks at the main gate. It has a seawater desalination plant, a marina where some of the residents' yachts and some armed patrol boats are moored. In addition, the compound has emergency power generators, a broadband satellite internet connection and a drone airfield, both for person carriers and autonomous drones, as well as a runway for fixed-wing aircraft. 

The food supply is provided by a seawater protein synthesis facility, which uses a 3D printing process to produce almost any type of food and adds synthetic vitamins and flavors. Since the process can also be coupled with the VR simulation, it is possible to supply oneself with food in the VR without having to log out, which some residents do excessively. Of course, almost any culinary specialties can be obtained via specialized courier services, provided that sufficient credits and contacts are available.

I turn around, with a push on the temple of my AR-Glasses I activate my personal assistant, an AI, which is specially tailored to my needs. "Jarvis, I can't take the news anymore today. Would it be possible for you to discreetly get me another glass of this gin? A black outline of a tall man appears in the glass door, fixes me briefly and disappears again into the darkness of the apartment. I hear a bottle being uncorked, ice cubes being dropped into a glass and the jingling of the ice cubes as the GIN washes around them. Moments later, the black outline appears on the balcony again with a glass of iced GIN and hands it to me with a quiet movement. "Thank you Jarvis, but that will remain our secret". No "problem - if I was no longer needed I would say goodbye to the store now". "Is good Jarvis".
The availability of such "Personal Assistants" has made drastic progress over the past fifty years. Almost every citizen of the world has access to a customized AI, but these are usually limited to Digital Assistants. Hardware, in this case a robot, is affordable only for very few people. There are different versions of such androids, on wheels, two-legged, four-legged, in fact realistic humanoids that are hardly distinguishable from humans. For obvious reasons, these are subject to strong restrictions in most countries, as they were often used in the past for assassinations and other sinister purposes. Although the Citadel is primarily governed by the terms and conditions of the service provider who maintains the Citadel, it has been established in these that humanoid androids are also not wanted inside the compound. This is fine with me and the other residents, since it has been shown in the past that the presence of such humanoid robots has a negative effect on the handling and well-being of the residents. For this reason, Jarvis, despite its human-like limbs, is not covered with synthetic skin but with titanium plates covered with graphite-based paint that absorbs 99.9% of the incident radiation. This leads to the fact that the robot is only perceived as a two-dimensional contour - a circumstance that causes various interesting effects especially in image processing AIs.

Jarvie's tasks essentially include the duties of a butler and personal trainer and mentor. Although it is an AI, Jarvis is not "omniscient" - designing a hyperintelligent AI has been moratoriumed worldwide because the technological singularity worldwide is regarded to end human ruling of the planet. Something that any political current and any party, no matter how messed up, wants to avoid. Of course, there are various sects or individuals, some of whom are trying to design such AIs with massive capital investment in order to "transcend" into a new social order. Such efforts are rigorously pursued by the so-called Touring Police - a 
The compound is surrounded by two high walls and a minefield. It is protected by a small army of mercenaries and AI Gatling/Laser hybrid guns mounted on mobile four-legged platforms and some anti-aircraft missile launchers. On the seaward side, active naval mines and anti-ship missile launchers are installed, which means that a very high degree of deterrence against unwanted visitors from the air, land and sea can be achieved with comparatively little logistical effort. The Costa Rican government is not expected to interfere with life inside the citadel, since Costa Rica's police force is technologically far inferior to the security forces of the compound. There has not been a military in Costa Rica for XXX years - which is probably one of the reasons for the popularity of Costarica 1 among the HNIs.
By means of a hypersonic airplane it is possible to reach any place on earth within 3 hours from the compound. This is achieved by a hypersonic parabolic flight of an ultra-long-range space vehicle. Originally developed by the US military, it has proven to be much more lucrative to fly high net worth individuals to their business meetings. In fact, due to the progress in VR technology, such flights have now been pushed into the background, as it is almost impossible to distinguish a VR environment from reality with the help of sense suits and VR glasses as well as immersion tanks, in which you float weightlessly in a salt solution. This has led to several interesting consequences, for example the phenomenon of sleepers, who have immersed themselves so deeply in the VR world and become so addicted that they no longer spend any time in the real world. For me a horrible idea but an increasing percentage of the world population is slowly but surely turning into sleepers, probably to escape their miserable living conditions. Not every citizen of the earth is in such a comfortable situation like me or my family.
I could have bought an autonomous car but this has several disadvantages on the one hand it is so that these cars can be controlled by artificial intelligence or even remotely which means that the manufacturer 1 override is right and can stop the car at any time if this violates different laws and on the other hand it is vulnerable to hacker attacks so I decided to buy an elegant alternative I bought an old Ford Raptor pickup truck with some Modifications bought the vehicle has an active and passive safety system apart from that it is mostly analog means the vehicle is not connected to the global network so it can operate self-sufficiently and becomes grey and is not susceptible to hacker attacks Since Jarvis best car can handle emergencies this means for me no no no losses uncomfortable furthermore it is a combustion engine with almost 700 HP which offers several advantages and disadvantages compared to electric vehicles. I regularly go jogging in the rainforest that belongs to the compound. Once I met a red and black striped snake there but Jarvis immediately removed it from the drive through the jungle. 

We live in a so-called citadel. In the past this term has been established for gated communities where extremely wealthy individuals live and do their business. Some of these citadels have a capital and military power that puts smaller countries in the shade. For example, many of the security guards employed here are veterans of the African water wars that broke out in the late 2020s, when drought became rampant in Africa. The resulting streams of refugees have led to the wealthy states finally giving up their freedom of movement and in some cases moving massive troop contingents to the borders. Bloody clashes broke out, in which many refugees lost their lives. 

Many of the employed security officers have served in armies or for private security companies in such conflicts, which probably makes them the best trained and equipped mercenaries on earth. Many of the people employed here are fabulously wealthy in terms of the average global income, and this is even more true for the residents, although it is almost impossible to determine the exact "net worth" of the Compound's residents. Many of the inhabitants of Costa Rica 1, as the Compound is called, have inherited their wealth from their parents and these in turn from their parents. Others have established successful companies, mostly in the financial services or information gathering sectors.

Monetary Union:
This holiday is celebrated by all countries of the new Monetary Union, which was proclaimed in 2035 by Switzerland, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Costa Rica, Malta, Venezuela, North Korea, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Russia, Iran and Israel. The monetary union includes all countries that have accepted the credits as the only legal tender. This means that a transaction must be settled in credits in all these countries.
Independent countries:
Several other countries have not yet joined the Monetary Union. These include the USA, China, Russia, India and Pakistan. In these countries, credits are prohibited and possession and trade is punishable by imprisonment and sometimes worse.

Global warming has been significantly reduced in the last 20 years. Unfortunately, the reversal of global warming came for many especially African countries and for many islanders and credits as a battery that made energy production in remote areas possible.
The world has changed dramatically since the 2020s
- Bitcoin Ban
- recession in countries which emphasized a Bitcoin standard which resulted in a deflation
Some countries were able to circumvent this problem by using "Covered 
- Some countries backed their local currencies with Bitcoin or abandoned their FIATS altogether. This triggered the prisoners dilemma punishing the countries which embraced Credits later harder. It was interesting to see the countries with the strongest currencies like the Yuan, the US Dollar or the Euro hold on to their currency the longest. This resulted in a wealth redistribution of epic proportions. All of that was catalyzed by the worldwide covid pandemic of the year 2020 which resulted in massive money printing sprees by many governments. As soon as the economy rebounded the effects were a massive inflation. So more and more people tried to preserve their wealth by buying credits. The effect was that many people in high government ranks saw either their money's purchasing power being diminished by inflation or they were already invested in credits. This penetration of the government apparatus with Credits supporters led in part to remarkably Credit-friendly laws.

Sea Citadels
Some Creditsfriends bought boats which they armed and disguised as tankers, which they convert to luxury yachts. Several of these boats formed agglomerations in international waters, so these water citadels were not subject to any jurisdiction. Communication is via a network of satellites operated by Blockstream, Spacex and various other companies.
Non-volatile data storage
Data storage has made significant progress in the last 10 years. Read only data are stored mainly on Zerodur cubes. This cube is extremely durable, heat and radiation as well as chemical and pressure resistant. The data is introduced by using focused laser radiation to introduce refractive index gradients into the surface, which in turn can be extracted using a complex system of lens arrays and illumination of the cube with coherent light. This is a read only system, which is especially used for the storage of keys. 
Space Citadels are also being planned, but they are exorbitantly expensive.

Ich persönlich habe mich gegen eine Bewerbung für die Aufnahme in eine solche sich in Planung befindliche Zitadelle entschlossen, da der Preis mich abschreckt, das Projekt noch in den Kinderschuhen steckt und ich vor allem ein grundsätzlicher Gegner des sogenannten Eskapismus bin, der es zum Ziel hat der Erde zu entfliehen, da dies den reichsten Individuen , die sich eine Flucht von der Erde leisten können ermöglicht den Planeten auszubeuten, ohne sich um die Konsequenzen eines solchen Handelns auseinandersetzen zu müssen. Ich bin der meinung als reicher Erdenbürger hat man eine gewisse verantwortung gegenüber der Weltbevölkerung und des Planeten und man solle sich besser darauf konzentrieren das Leben auf dem Planeten für möglichst viele menschen so lebenswürdig wie möglich zu gestalten. Da wir nur diese eine Erde zur verfügung haben sollten wir sie für zukünftige Generationen so gut wie möglich preserven. Darüber hinaus möchte ich mich während meines Lebensabends nur ungerne harter kosmischer Strahlung aussetzen. Natürlich besteht die möglichkeit diese abzuschirmen, beispielsweise indem man die Wasservorräte der Raumstation in die Außenhülle der Station integriert, dies hat allerdings wiederum verschiedene Nachteile, so können Mikrometeoriten oder SpaceJunk beispielsweise die Außenhülle der Station schädigen wodurch das lebenswichtige Nass ins all austritt. Keine schöne Vorstellung für ein Retirement Home.

Da viele HODLER sehr wohlhabende Menschen sind konnten sich diese in verschiedenen Regierungen Einfluss erkaufen oder diese unterwandern. Dies wurde insbesondere durch die fortschritte des Credit Protokolls wie TapRoot oder Schnorr signaturen oder das Lightning netzwerk eingeführt die bereits 2022 zur Verfügung standen und den Identitätsschutz der beteiligten Personen erhöht haben und dadurch dazu geführt haben dass es heute nahezu unmöglich ist, den exakten Besitz festzustellen.

- Kalte Fusion - Privater Besitz von Nuklearreaktoren - Island und die Sub sahara region sind zu finanzzentren herangewachsen, da sich hier mit erneuerbaren energien die notwendige Rechenkapazität zur bestätigung der Transaktionen des Creditnetzwerks. 
A bunch of crazies bought the first fusion reactor Wendelstein 7-X from the german government in the late 2030s after the looming financial crisis required the government to sell all non essencial assets. This Fusion reactor has been used since for extended bitcoin mining. Something similar happened in the Ukraine, where the government was forced to sell a nuclear power plant to a high net worth individual. Again the produced electricity was used to mine bitcoins and ensure the network's stability. 

- Private Söldnerarmeen spielen mittlerweile eine sehr wichtige rolle um die Interessen von Staaten oder individuen international durchsetze zu können. Auch hier regiert die Marktwirtschaft, was dazu geführt hat, dass einzelne individuen mehr militärische Macht ausüben können als dies viele Staaten tun können.

Jarvis
Wie wurde trainiert von Grund auf da es risikoreich ist bereits trainierte künstliche Intelligenzen zu verwenden ohne zu wissen welche Vielheit relevanten Modifikationen an dem neuronalen Netzwerk durchgeführt wurden aus diesem Grund haben wir uns dazu entschlossen ciao bis von Grund auf selbst zu trainieren erst so mit so etwas wie unser zweites Kind. Jarvis ist ein humanoider da mit einer einfachen künstlichen Intelligenz ausgerüstet ist aktiviert wird er mittels Sprachbefehl bei wobei verschiedene Faktoren übereinstimmen müssen sodass ein Befehl als Sprachbefehl von seinem Besitzer anerkannt wird so ist Jarvis nur auf meine Stimme sowie die meiner Frau und meiner Tochter programmiert darüber hinaus wird Jarvis immer versuchen visuellen Kontakt mit mir oder meiner Frau herzustellen um sicherstellen zu können dass es sich um legitime Befehle handelt Mist justice von scharfes besteht aus einer gehärteten Titanlegierung welchem mit einem schwarzen Lack überzogen ist diese nackt passiert auch für einer carbon nanotubes und absorbiert Licht zu 99,99% dies hat zur Folge dass Charles mehr oder weniger nur als schwarzer Umriss mit einigen LED-Lichtern wahrzunehmen ist für diese es etwas extravagante Lackierung habe ich mich entschieden da man so verschiedene Features seines Körpers sehr gut verschleiern kann außerdem wirkt es nicht aufdringlich. 
Lao Wei 
Lao Wei ist der nordkoreanische Hacker dass sich darauf spezialisiert hat die in denen die Daten von HNIs ist aufzudecken und diese an beispielsweise die CAU zu verkaufen der Handels solcher identitäten dabei über das Darknet in einer VR statt. Eine besonders ergiebige Quelle personenbezogener Daten von reichen Personen sind die ist das Hacken von der frühen Bitcoin Tauschbörsen, da damals die Sicherheitsvorkehrung von den meisten Nutzern und auch Tauschbörsen selbst nicht als besonders kritisch/notwendig erachtet wurden. 

Besonders wertvoll sind dabei Accounts, deren Coins sei dem Jahr 2017 oder früher nicht mehr bewegt wurden, was bedeutet dass die Keys entweder gestohlen verloren gegangen sind oder aber die Personen die damals und die Coins gekauft haben immer noch über diese verfügen. 
Über einen Algorithmus (Chainalysis) lassen sich diesen Wallets teilweise die IDs der Käufer zuordnen. Diese “Golden Geese” stellen für Wei die Accounts dar, die besonders lohnenswerte Ziele sind. So lässt sich außerdem anhand von verschiedenen Transaktionen insbesondere wenn der Nutzer keine hohe IP Sicherheit betreibt eine Bestimmung des Vermögens des Nutzers durchführen. Sollte dieser amerikanischer Staatsbürger sein, und Seinen Wohnsitz ins Ausland verlagert haben, so wird die Exit Tax automatisch berechnet und es wird eine Art Kopfgeld die Person ausgesetzt. Solche “golden geese” werden nicht nur von der CAU sondern auch von Freelancern gejagt. 
The hunt 
Donner grollte und das konstante Prasseln des Regens war derart penetrant, dass es den Inhärenten Geräuschpegel des Tropischen Regenwaldes, der uns umgab fast vollständig unterdrückte. Ab und an übertönte nur der Schrei eines Affen oder das Rufen sonderbarer Tropischer Vögel daas monotone Rauschen im Blätterdach über und um uns herum. 

Eduardo stapft barfuß vor mir her, ich fluchend hinter ihm drein. Auf meinem Rücken gräbt sich die Kohlefaser Armbrust in meinen Rücken. In meinen Gummistiefeln steht das Wasser so hoch, dass es oben aus dem Stiefelschaft herausläuft. Eduardo dreht sich zu mir um und grinst mich an - “Oye Chefe - mis piedras son mas secos que los tuyos sin zapatos”. Anscheinend hält er es für ziemlich dumm, sich Stiefel anzuziehen, wenn ohnehin alles unter Wasser steht. Da hat er nicht unrecht trotzdem habe ich als “Gringo” einen heiden Respekt vor den verschiedenen Kriechtieren, die sich hier im Jungel tummeln, und ich möchte nur ungern von einer viper in den unterschenkel gebissen werden. 

Flussbett sie waren auf der Suche nach einem alten Bekannten einem Jaguar dessen Spuren sie schon häufiger hier in diese Bereiche in diesem Bereich entdeckt haben ist ein sehr ambitionierter Hobbyjäger und verwendet für die Jagd hier in dem Urwald eine vergleichsweise großkalibrige Edelstahl ein ruhiges Edelstahl Repetiergewehr mit Schalldämpfer und Carbonschaft normalerweise würden Jäger holzgewehre mit Nummer kohlenstoffhaltigen Schalen verwenden jedoch haben sich als solche im Dschungel aufgrund der klimatischen Verhältnisse als nicht sehr geeignet Wiesn racials außerdem mit diesem Gewerbe sehr sehr zufrieden und hat damit schon in verschiedensten Regionen der Welt G8 allerdings nie in so einer Nerv töten im grünen Hölle wie die im Regenwald in Costa Rica

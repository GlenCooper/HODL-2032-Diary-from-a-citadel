# HODL-2032-Diary-from-a-citadel

This is the private Repository of the collaborative Project of a bitcoin based SciFi Novel "HODL 2032 - Diary from a citadel" which I started to write due to a lack of bitcoin themed Sci Fi, which I personally enjoy a lot.

For the time being this page will be private until we cleaned up the document so that we can open it for public. That means mainly to translate what has been written to English and setting up some rules for collaboration once it is public.

To Dos (first steps):

1.  Translate everything to english (e.g. via DeepL and subsequent editing)
2.  Establish a "Way of working" by testing collaboration via GitHub
3.  Set up a Telegram channel to coordinate interested Authors collaboration
4.  Donations? Necessary? What to use them for? (Publishing etc.?)
5.  Which License to use? (relevant only when it is public).
... to be continued

CAU Agent Astrid BÃ¸rman

This is necessary because of course all incoming and outgoing data connections can be monitored by her liaison officer via  fiber optic cable. 
The agent has a retinal implant, which not only enables her to display augmented reality functionalities in the peripheral retinal area, but also enables her liaison officer to access her "LiveFeed" at any time - for example to check whether she has embezzled confiscated currency. However, the agent has no way of knowing whether this has actually ever happened. The CAU is thus concerned with "debt capital consolidation" - another word for government-sponsored theft. In fact, such a procedure is known - a prominent example is the privateer Francis Drake who, in the name of the English Crown, robbed merchants and sailors of their wealth as early as the 15th century. It can only move outside the legality of the IS to a certain extent, as it is monitored via the net heap. The really bad things are done by Wikus. Whether the retinal implant is actually permanent or just randomly monitored or even monitored at all, Astrid knows that even if she would break the law she would never be punished this would never be punished as the government is too dependent on the foreign exchange he procures from it to allow itself to initiate an investigation against one of its most successful agents

Jarvis (better Name for an AI needed)
How to train from scratch because it is risky to use already trained artificial intelligence without knowing how many relevant modifications have been made to the neural network and therefore we decided to train from scratch with something like our second child. Jarvis is a humanoid as he is equipped with a simple artificial intelligence and is activated by voice commands where different factors have to match so that a command is recognized as a voice command by its owner so Jarvis is programmed only on my voice and that of my wife and daughter about In addition, Jarvis will always try to make visual contact with me or my wife to make sure that these are legitimate orders. Mist justice of sharp is made of a hardened titanium alloy which is coated with a black lacquer which happens naked even for a carbon nanotube and absorbs light to 99, 99% this has the consequence that Charles is more or less only perceived as a black outline with some LED lights. For this somewhat extravagant painting I decided to use a black outline because it is very good to hide different features of his body and it is not obtrusive. 

Lao Wei 
Lao Wei is the North Korean hacker who specializes in uncovering the data of HNIs and selling them to, for example, the CAU to trade such identities over the dark net in a VR. A particularly rich source of personal data from rich people is the hacking of the early Bitcoin file-sharing sites, as the security measures were not considered critical/necessary by most users or even file-sharing sites themselves.
